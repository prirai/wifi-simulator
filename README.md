# oopd-project - WiFi Simulator

A WiFi simulator project designed to model and analyze WiFi standards - 4, 5 and 6.

## Usage

To build the debug version: `make debug`, the optimized version: `make optimized`.
These are the debug and the optimized versions of the executable.

Run the optimized version using `./optimized`

## Files

The following files are generated by the Makefile:

- libWiFiSimLib.a: The static library containing the object files for the WiFi Simulator.
- `AccessPoint.o`, `Globals.o`, `Packet.o`, `Simulator.o`, `User.o`, `Utils.o`, `WiFiAccessPoints.o`, `WiFiChannel.o` are the object files created from respective cpp files and their libraries.


## Class Structure

### WiFi Standards
- `AccessPoint`: Contains shared attributes like `id`, `currentTime`, and `maxConcurrentUsers`. It also defines the interface for packet transmission and bandwidth handling.

- **Derived Classes**:
    - `WiFi4AccessPoint`: Implements the functionality of a WiFi 4 access point using CSMA-CA.
    - `WiFi5AccessPoint`: Implements the functionality of a WiFi 5 access point using MU-MIMO.
    - `WiFi6AccessPoint`: Implements the functionality of a WiFi 6 access point using OFDMA.

- `Globals.h` - Contains some global variables and containers like `users_remaining`, `ap_standard`, `maxPackets`, `debugstream`, `infostream`.
- `Utils.h` - Contains utility functions for printing debug and info messages.
- `Packet.h` - The `Packet` class models data packets with attributes like size, start time, transmission time, and 
latency. It provides methods to calculate transmission time based on bandwidth and encoding parameters, as well as getters and setters for managing packet properties.
- `Simulator.h` - The `Simulator` class manages WiFi simulations, handling user creation, access point initialization, and packet transmission. It computes metrics like throughput, average latency, and maximum latency, and logs results to a file.
- `User.h` - The `User` class models a network user with an ID, a queue of packets to send, and properties like backoff time and latency. It includes methods to generate packets, attempt transmission via an access point, and manage backoff and latency during communication.
- `WiFiChannel` - The `WiFiChannel` class represents a WiFi communication channel with attributes like bandwidth and occupancy state. It provides methods to check channel availability, occupy the channel for a duration, and release it after use.
